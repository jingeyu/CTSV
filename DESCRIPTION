Description: 
    The R package CTSV implements the CTSV approach developed by Jinge Yu 
    and Xiangyu Luo that detects cell-type-specific spatially variable genes 
    accounting for excess zeros. CTSV directly models sparse raw count data 
    through a zero-inflated negative binomial regression model, incorporates 
    cell-type proportions, and performs hypothesis testing based on R package 
    pscl.vThe package outputs p-values and q-values for genes in each cell type, 
    and CTSV is scalable to datasets with tens of thousands of genes measured on 
    hundreds of spots. CTSV can be installed in Windows, Linux, and Mac OS.
